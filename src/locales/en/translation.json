      "I was born in Venezuela with Colombian roots, always driven by a passion for drawing and a curiosity for technology. After graduating in Graphic Design during the early days of the web boom, I quickly became fascinated by web design and development. My curiosity led me to explore programming, which has been at the heart of my professional path since 2015.",
      "Some of these changes came hand in hand with personal challenges, including two migrations and my attitude toward them, has guided me through this professional and personal roller-coaster journey, leading me to places I could never have imagined.",
      "Today, I live in Lucerne with my wonderful family, grateful for the path that brought me here."
